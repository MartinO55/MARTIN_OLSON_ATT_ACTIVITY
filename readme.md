# Flashtalking Coding Exercise

So the way I read this problem is that the objective is to download some remote data,  manipulate and transform that data, then reuppload it to a different remote server using a different protocol. I don't see any requirement for, or place the source code can be uploaded to, so I guess this git repository will have to serve if anyone wants to see it.

A quick following of the first link provided confirms the data is there and is properly formatted JSON, but I am hesitant to try the second link because I don't know if there have been any conditions placed on the server with regards to the number of times it can be accessed or such.

With no additional instructions as to how this script should work, where it should run, etc, I think we just run it as a web dashboard page to make sure it is doing the correct thingsas we build the script.
